# Estuaries-Project
This is my internship project
I cannot upload the data for obvious reasons :)

During my summer 2025 internship at SMAST's Estuary Lab, I successfully managed and automated the analysis of 38 years of estuary water quality data for Massachusetts environmental monitoring. My primary responsibilities included digitizing historical data from 1987-1994 that previously existed only as scanned documents, standardizing data formats across multiple decades, and developing comprehensive automation tools for ongoing data analysis. Key accomplishments included creating a complete digital database system, implementing PowerQuery ETL automation that reduced report generation from weeks to minutes, and building four interactive dashboards including an outlier detection system for quality control. This experience provided invaluable hands-on learning in environmental data science while directly supporting Massachusetts state government coastal management decisions. The internship significantly enhanced my understanding of the intersection between computer science and environmental research, particularly within the blue economy sector focused on sustainable coastal and marine resource management.
